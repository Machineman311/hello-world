# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository

I am a CNC programmer who's always wanted to learn how to program computers.
I took a QBASIC class for half a semester at a community college once.
I have been teaching myself C++ lately and started using SoloLearn to get the basics of other languages as well.
Lately, after finding a book at the library, I've had a fascination with Golang.
Probably because I'm a little bit of a GooGle Fan-Boy.
